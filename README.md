# Health-Tracker
Users can record simple actions such as drinking water, doing exercise, or sleeping enough. The system gives points and feedback each day, and if all habits are completed, it gives a badge to encourage progress. It can also show your daily streak, weekly average, and even a leaderboard to see how you compare with others.
