# Health-Tracker
This is my first project at the **University of Sydney**.  
It is a simple Python program that helps users build healthy habits by tracking daily actions such as drinking water, exercising, and sleeping enough hours.

The project includes both a **terminal version** and a **simple GUI version** built with Tkinter.  
It allows users to:
- Record their daily habits
- Earn points and feedback
- Track streaks and weekly averages
- View leaderboards and compare progress

This project is part of my learning journey in Python programming and my first experience building a complete interactive program at the University of Sydney.
